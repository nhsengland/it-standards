title: Standards for new IT Services
description: >
   NHSEI operates a cloud-first and SaaS-first approach to IT in line with UK Government guidelines.
   As such, it is much preferred for new IT to be procured as a managed _Service_ rather than as a system.

   This section provides guidance on the procurement and management of IT Services.

The focus and priority of NHSEI is on the management of healthcare in England. It is not on the development of bespoke software and services.

As such, we should always be looking for _standard operating models_ and _Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS)_ products wherever possible.
This gives us the benefits of many other people and organisations inputting to the operating model in order to find the best one
and for that model to continue to improve over time.

Such models and products should be procured as _services_ wherever possible. This means that they are fully managed by a 3<sup>rd</sup>-party on our behalf.

## Benefits of a service/COTS approach

* We benefit from other people and organisations honing in on the best approaches.
* We benefit from being able to recruit people with pre-existing skills and knowledge.
* We don't have to reinvent the wheel to operate.
* We don't commit ourselves to ongoing maintenance and development of software.
* We don't commit ourselves to ongoing maintenance and development of infrastructure.
