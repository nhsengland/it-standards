# Physical Infrastructure Standards (Data-Centre and On-Premise)

Physical infrastructure refers to compute and networking devices that are deployed to non-cloud locations. For example to a data-centre or another physical location.

## Location

NHSEI IT has a preferred set of data-centres that MUST be used above any other location for physical IT hardware. Contact IT for details.

Physical IT infrastructure MUST NOT be installed into any other location than approved data-centres.

Specifically, general office locations are NOT suitable for the deployment of IT infrastructure other than required local networking. 
The installation of servers to office locations will NOT be approved.

In most office locations, the communications rooms set aside for networking equipment cannot be considered to be secure.

## Data-Centres

The only data-centres approved for NHSEI IT infrastructure are ones that are secured to UK Government standards where:

* Access to the site is controlled by 24hr guards.
* The equipment is isolated from other organisations.
* Sufficient HVAC and fire suppression is available.
* Access is limited to a pre-approved list of **security cleared** personnel.

NHSEI handles multiple classifications of data up to SECRET and all data-centres MUST assume that they will be required to handle classified data at that level.

## Office Communications Rooms

Each NHSEI site must have a designated, locked area for the deployment of communications equipment. This primarily consists of:

* One or more lockable 19" racks, securely mounted over a raised floor.
* Sufficient power and air-conditioning (HVAC) for the size of room and amount of equipment deployed.

Ideally, the room should:

* Be locked and only accessible by pre-approved personnel.
* Have a process for allowing pre-approved and logged access from vendors (e.g. BT for telecoms).
* Have a filtered air-conditioning unit to prevent the build-up of dust and debris in expensive communications equipment.
* Be only used for communications equipment and not used for storage, printing or other high-footfall purposes.

It should be noted that the racks, air-conditioning, electrical power supplies may all constitute health and safety risks in addition to the security and privacy risks created by allowing untrained, unapproved staff access.
