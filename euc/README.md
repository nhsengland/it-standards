# End User Compute (EUC) Standards

EUC covers "desktop" devices (desktops, laptops, convertables and tablets running desktop operating systems such as Microsoft Windows or Apple OSX).
EUC also covers mobile devices (smartphones and tablets running mobile operating systems such as Apple iOS and Google Android).

These are the standards that apply to the provision and use of EUC devices.
