"Managed" means that the software is actively reviewed for updates and security issues and updated accordingly. Any deployments of the software must be actively updated. Old versions will not be permitted without an approved exception that must be actively managed and eliminated as soon as feasible.

* Only *currently supported* versions of software and services are permitted

* Only 1 version of any specific software or service may be deployed. 
  
  Older versions must be actively removed from deployment.

  Test/preview versions may, of course, be deployed for testing purposes for a limited period.

* Long-Term Support (LTS) versions will be used where available.

  Where multiple LTS versions exist, the latest version will not be used unless there is an overriding business reason. 
  
  Where 3 or more LTS versions exist, the aim will be to be on the middle version.

* Patches and minor updates will be applied according to the agreed Cyber Security patching schedules. Urgent/security patches and updates to be applied no later than 14d after release by the vendor. Where this is not possible due to business criticality an exception must be obtained from the SIRO, according to the HSA guidelines.

!> Active monitoring of NHS England systems and services is used to review outdated software. Where discovered, staff will be asked to assist in their removal. In extreme cases, it may be necessary to enforce removal.

> Please note that these restrictions come from adherance to UK Government and NHS rules around cyber security as well as ensuring minimal overheads to the organisation.
