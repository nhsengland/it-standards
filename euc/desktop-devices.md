# Standards for Desktop EUC devices

**Documentation Stage**: 3. Development Stage

> Development stage documents are incomplete and in-progress. They are actively looking for feedback.

**Please note that this standard is not yet ratified**

Desktop EUC devices are desktops, laptops, convertables and tablets running desktop operating systems such as Microsoft Windows or Apple OSX.

Note that the standard and developer device will comprise the majority of corporate desktop devices. These devices will generally be from one vendor (or a small number of) and the available types are limited in order to reduce capital and support costs. Maintaining multiple device types from multiple vendors quickly gets expensive both in procurement and for maintenance, support, logistics, etc.

It should be noted that **ALL** EUC devices issued by NHSEI and NHSX are subject to ongoing operational and security monitoring.
Compromised devices may be remotely locked and/or wiped.

## Standard Device

This device type is aimed at providing the requirements for 80-90% of all staff.

The standard device type is a "Wintel" lightweight laptop with the following minimum features:

* Windows 10 Enterprise capable
* Lightweight laptop form-factor
* 64-bit processor with VM extensions - Intel i5 or AMD equivalent or better
* TPM 2+ chip
* Colour 13" <sup name="a1">[fn1](#f1)</sup> multi-touch screen (pen input preferred where costs allow <sup name="a2">[fn2](#f2)</sup>)
* 256GiB SSD or more. Ideally M4 SATA III or better.

## Developer/Power User Device

This device type is aimed at users requiring more power than the standard devices. No more than 10-15% of users should have these devices. If >10%, the standards should be reviewed.

The standard device type is a "Wintel" laptop with the following minimum features:

* Windows 10 Enterprise capable
* Laptop form-factor (will be heavier and larger than the standard device)
* 64-bit processor with VM extensions - Intel i7 or AMD equivalent or better
* TPM 2+ chip
* Colour 15" <sup name="a1">[fn1](#f1)</sup> multi-touch screen (pen input preferred where costs allow <sup name="a2">[fn2](#f2)</sup>)
* 512GiB SSD or more. Ideally M4 SATA III or better.

## Alternative Device Type

TBC.


## Footnotes

1. <span name="f1"></span>Standard laptop screens of around 13" are the standard for the majority of staff. However, alternatives are offered with screen sizes around 15". Typically for developers and power users who may not mind a slightly heavier laptop in exchange for the greater power and screen size. [↩](#a1)
2. <span name="f2"></span>Pen input screens can be very useful to many areas of the business. However, their extra cost often means that they are overlooked. [↩](#a2)
