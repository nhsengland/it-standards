* The **[NHS Long Term Plan](https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/areas-of-work/digital-transformation/)** - ‘Set standards that keep information secure and make sure NHS IT systems talk to each other to provide health and care staff with complete access to joined up patient records.’​

The OECD's Observatory of Public Sector Innovation (OPSI) also has a useful [list of worldwide innovation toolkits](https://oecd-opsi.org/search-toolkits/) that include other governments takes on digital innovation and development.
