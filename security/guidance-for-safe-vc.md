## Using video conference tools safely

The NCSC has excellent guidance on [using video conferencing services safely](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/video-conferencing-services-using-them-securely).

Key things to remember *before* a call include:

-   Make sure your video conferencing account (or the device or app you are using for video conferencing) is protected with a strong password.
-   Test the service before making (or joining) your first call.
-   Understand what features are available, for example recording the call or sharing files or screen information.

Key things to remember for *every* call include:

-   Do not make the calls public, for example always require a password to join the call.
-   Know who is joining the call, in particular check that everyone is known and expected to be present, and that people who have dialled in have identified themselves clearly and sufficiently.
-   Consider your surroundings, for example checking what can be seen behind you \(forgetting to check information on a whiteboard or noticeboard is an easy mistake\).
