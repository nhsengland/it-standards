Please note that this guidance is based on [that of the Ministry of Justice](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/general-user-video-and-messaging-apps-guidance/) and adapted for use at NHS England.

## Overview

Various tools are approved and provided corporately to NSHEI staff. This document tells you about the tools you can, and cannot, use for business purposes. This guidance applies to all staff, seconded, embedded, and contractor users who work with and for NHS England and NHS Improvement.

Some ALBs, Agencies, or other associated organisations may have their own, specific guidance regarding how to use certain Video and Messaging apps for different purposes.

## Corporate, work and personal accounts

-   A work or corporate account is for OFFICIAL NHS England work. You MUST NOT share access to such accounts. All work undertaken by and for NHS England is [classified as OFFICIAL](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications) unless otherwise noted.
-   A personal account is your own personal account on Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, and so on. You should not use a personal account for business purposes.

Remember that, when using public services using a work account, your statements may be taken as OFFICIAL. You must take great care when using public services, especially social media. Please refer to the _Acceptable Use_, _Social Media_, and [Standards of Business Conduct](https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/standards-of-business-conduct-policy/) Policies for additional information.

## Policy and guidance

### `OFFICIAL` and `OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` Information

`OFFICIAL` information is the majority of information that is created or processed by the public sector. This includes routine business operations and services, some of which could have damaging consequences if lost, stolen or published in the media, but are not subject to a heightened threat profile.

`OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE` is not a classification. `SENSITIVE` is a handling caveat for a small subset of information marked `OFFICIAL` that requires special handling by staff. You should apply the handling caveat where you wish to control access to that information, whether in a document, email, or other form.

Please contact the Information Governance team if you are uncertain about information classifications and refer to the [UK Government guidance on security and handling of information](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications).

### Privacy and personal information (Data Protection)

Some communications tools expect to have a copy of your contacts list. The list is uploaded to the tool server in order to let the tool to function correctly. **Think carefully about whether this is reasonable to do**. Make sure that sharing your contacts list does not impact any one else's privacy in a negative way.

**Remember that public services regularly get compromised and private data stolen. This does not just impact you but also all of the contacts you have uploaded.**

Data protection legislation makes _you_ responsible for personal information you work with. You must keep it safe and secure. In particular, you must follow data protection obligations. These include the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

You local Information Governance or Records Management representative can help if you are uncertain. Please look on the Intranet for more details.

### Information Management

Many of the tools are only used for your day-to-day collaboration with colleagues. The information you work with is typically [classified](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications) at `OFFICIAL`.

Think about the information you work with when using these tools. What would happen if you lost your mobile device, or it's stolen? Suppose a voice or video call was overheard in a cafÃ©, or information read from your screen on a crowded train. Could there be damaging consequences? If the answer is 'No', then it's probably OK to use the tool to collaborate on that information with colleagues.

You have a _duty of confidentiality_ and a responsibility to safeguard any NHS and HMG information or data that you access. This is [Principle 2](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications) of the Government Security Classifications. The NHS trusts you to work with `OFFICIAL` information. You're trusted to make a reasoned judgement about whether it's safe to use an approved tool, or whether you should use a different corporately-provided work tool.

Remember that it is impossible to delete information after it's released in public.

### Storage and data retention

Laws and regulations make NHS England, NHS Improvement and its employees responsible for managing information. Some examples include:

-   Freedom of Information Act.
-   Data Protection Act and General Data Protection Regulation.
-   Public Records Acts.

When we receive a request for information, we need to know where we hold all the relevant information. Storing business information on appropriate corporate systems helps us, because:

-   We can provide evidence about decisions.
-   We understand the information held, and where to find it.
-   We can transfer records to The National Archives.

Therefore, always store NHS information in NHS systems. If you use a tool for work tasks, make sure the key information is stored in an appropriate NHS system. Guidance on what you must keep is available on the Intranet, search for "Records Management" . At regular and convenient intervals, transfer the information to an appropriate NHS system. Do the same when you finish the work. Don't forget to remove any redundant information from a tool by clearing or deleting data if it has been preserved in an NHS system.

Many tools lets you export your data. You can then store it on an appropriate NHS system. Sometimes it's easier to copy and paste text into a new document. Make sure that only the correct people have access to the information. This is important after staff or organisational changes, for example.

For more guidance, read the Records Management and Freedom of Information sections on the Intranet.

## Acceptable Use

You must use tools for business purposes in an acceptable way.

Be sensible when using tools for NHS and UK Government business purposes:

-   Be extra careful with sensitive and personal information in tools.
-   Try to avoid using the same tool for business and personal use - you can get confused between them.
-   If the message you're about to send might cause problems, upset, offence, or embarrassment, it's not acceptable.
-   Context is important - a message you might think is funny could be upsetting to someone else.
-   If something goes wrong, report it.

The bottom line is:

> If there is doubt, there is no doubt - ask for help!

## Accessibility

All tools in use in NHS England MUST be accessible to all. This is both a legal and moral requirement.

Please see the [accessibility document in the development section](application-development/common-dev/accessibility) for more information regarding standards that must be met.

## Corporate tools

These are the preferred corporate tools for communications and collaboration. These should always be used by preference. They are secured to NHS and UK Government approved levels, have audit capabilities, backup and retention data policies and are generally centrally funded.

## Other tools

Some tools, such as Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn, are approved for specific corporate accounts to use, for corporate communications messages. General use of these tools for work purposes is not permitted.

If you wish to use a tool that is not listed above, please consult our [Guidance for using Open Internet Tools](guidance-for-using-open-internet-tools.md) or contact the Cyber Security team. Any tool or service that would be used for OFFICIAL business MUST be approved before use or purchase. The *Technology Request & Requirements Form* (on the Service Now service portal) can be used to engage with the Technical Design Authority who will assess and feed back accordingly.

## Requesting that an app be approved for use

If there is an application or service that is not currently approved, but which you would like to use, you can request a review via the *Technology Request & Requirements Form*. That form is accessed via the IT Service Portal. The submission will be reviewed by the Technical Design Authority which meets weekly. If given technical approval, the TDA will forward the request to other approvers and will outline any next steps required.

Please note that the TDA will assess against business need and fit to NHS England strategy and policy.

Additional approvers may need to include the Cyber Security team, Enterprise Applications team, Finance and Commercial teams.

The app or service will be reviewed to check things like how safe it is to use, and whether there are any costs, data privacy implications, service implications or impact on other apps and services. TDA and other approvers will respond to you with an answer as quickly as possible but they get many requests so please leave plenty of time and be patient.

**Note:** You should submit a request, and wait for a formal âapprovalâ response, *before* you install or use the app/service on NHS equipment or information.
