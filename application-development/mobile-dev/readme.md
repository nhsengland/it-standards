# Mobile Development Standards

These standards apply when designing and implementing new or updated mobile applications.

"Mobile" means running on a device that uses a Mobile Operating System. Typically Apple iOS or Google Android. This may include some tablets or hybrid devices.

## Core

All mobile applications

* **MUST follow the [common development standards](application-development/common-dev/readme).**
* MUST be pre-approved by the UK Government Cabinet Office Government Digital Service. 

  NHSEI have a pre-approvals board, DPAG, to help teams and projects get through the approvals requirements.

  No mobile application may be developed or deployed with GDS approval.

* SHOULD use open development standards where feasible. 

  Noting that each Mobile Operating System has its own proprietary development stacks and languages that may need to be used. However, web-applications with offline features should be considered first. High-level designs, risk and design-decision logs must record the reasoning behind using proprietary tooling.
