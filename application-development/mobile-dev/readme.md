# Mobile Development Standards

These standards apply when designing and implementing new or updated mobile applications.

"Mobile" means running on a device that uses a Mobile Operating System. Typically Apple iOS or Google Android. This may include some tablets or hybrid devices.

## Core

All mobile applications

* MUST be pre-approved by the UK Government Cabinet Office Government Digital Service. 

  NHSEI have a pre-approvals board, DPAG, to help teams and projects get through the approvals requirements.

  No mobile application may be developed or deployed with GDS approval.

* SHOULD use open development standards where feasible. 

  Noting that each Mobile Operating System has its own proprietary development stacks and languages that may need to be used. However, web-applications with offline features should be considered first. High-level designs, risk and design-decision logs must record the reasoning behind using proprietary tooling.

* MUST follow the NHS and UK Government (Cabinet Office Government Digital Service) Design Manual's.
* MUST follow the security guidelines set out by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).
* MUST meet WAI standards for accessibility.
* SHOULD follow the security guidelines set out by NIST.
