# Platform Development Standards

These standards apply when developing a new "platform" which is to say, a service or (set of) applications and tools that allow people to create business applications.

For example, the rewrite of the FutureNHS collaboration site using a new open source Content Management System (CMS) is considered a platform since it may be used to create any number of services.

# Core

Any platform development:

* MUST follow the [common standards](../common-dev)
* MUST follow the NHS and UK Government (Cabinet Office Government Digital Service) Design Manual's.
* MUST follow the security guidelines set out by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).
* MUST meet WAI standards for accessibility.
* SHOULD use open web-development standards.
* SHOULD follow the security guidelines set out by NIST.
