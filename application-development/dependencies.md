All tooling and software dependencies, whether used to help develop or used to support business applications, must use currently supported software and services.

It is not acceptable for business applications to use outdated software or services. Ones that are not under current, active support.

Development projects must allow for ongoing maintenance and updates of dependent software.

In regards to software used to support development, it must follow the same [standards as for desktop software](../euc/permitted-versions.md) even if server-based.
