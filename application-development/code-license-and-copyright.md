# Copyright and Licensing for Code and Documentation

As a general standard, all code and associated documentation produced by and on behalf of (however commissioned) must be dual licensed under MIT and OGL v3.

All code and documentation will have Crown Copyright.

All code repositories **MUST** be accompanied by a file in the root folder called `LICENSE` which must contain a copy of the OGL license. A copy of the MIT license should also be included. Copies of those files can be found in the [root folder of this IT Standards Repository](https://github.com/nhsengland/it-standards).

As a consequence of this standard, anything carrying a license of GPL, AGPL or similar **CANNOT** be included. Contact Corporate IT if this is an issue so that the legal issues can be worked through and approved or worked around.

MIT, Apache, and similar licenses may be included. In those cases, the appropriate license files **MUST** be included in the repository and the documentation must make clear which licenses apply to what.
