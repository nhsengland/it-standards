## Core

All development of applications and services by and for NHSEI are subject to UK Government and general NHS strategies. 
As such, they MUST use _Cloud First_ principles.

Developments requiring local infrastructure will require additional scrutiny and governance and will mostly be rejected without a clear and convincing business case.

NHSEI's cloud platform of choice is Microsoft Azure. Use of other platforms is strongly discouraged only because of the additional complexity and overheads of trying to support 
multiple global cloud platforms. Use of other platforms is subject to approval by the Architecture Review Board and even if approved is likely to result in ongoing support and
maintenance costs that will need to be born by the key stakeholders.
