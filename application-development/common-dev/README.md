# Common Applications Development Standards

Please note that ALL application development in NHS England and NHS Improvement is subject to the IT Requests & Approvals process.

No development should be started or considered without informing IT PMO so that it can be reviewed. You can then be supported through the
various phases of work and approvals that may be required. Finance will not accept any business cases that involve technology or IT that have not been approved by IT.

Proposals will be reviewed on fit to policies, strategies and standards; resourcing; budgets; security and information governance.

These apply to all development. See also the specific development type standards:

* [Business Applications Development](./business-dev)
* [Internet Applications Development](./internet-dev)
* [Mobile Applications Development](./mobile-dev)
* [Platforms Applications Development](./platform-dev)

Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) document for details of how to contribute to these standards.
