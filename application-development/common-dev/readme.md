Please note that ALL application development in NHS England and NHS Improvement is subject to the IT Requests & Approvals process.

No development may be started or considered without informing IT PMO so that it can be reviewed. You can then be supported through the
various phases of work and approvals that may be required. Finance will not accept any business cases that involve technology or IT that have not been approved by IT.
Some projects will require additional approvals from other bodies, refer to the latest IT request process for details. Additional approvals may include (but are not limited to), DPAG/GDS and ARB. This is in addition to any commercial and financial approvals.

Proposals will be reviewed on fit to policies, strategies and standards; resourcing; budgets; security and information governance.
