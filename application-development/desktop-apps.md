# Standards for the Development of Desktop Applications

In general, desktop applications SHOULD NOT be developed.

All applications for use on desktop operating systems should be developed as [**web applications**](/application-development/web-dev/readme).

Requests for the development of new desktop applications will generally be declined.

Desktop applications are mostly over-complex for the business requirements they are designed to meet.
In addition, they may need ongoing packaging and support, integration and testing on a wide variety of devices which adds significant cost and resource overheads that are not needed.
