# Business Applications Development Standards

Business applications are bespoke applications developed on corporate/business platforms and will typically use C#, C++, Visual Basic.net, SQLserver, etc. They may be hosted on-premise or in the cloud.

Please read the [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) document for details of how to contribute to these standards.
